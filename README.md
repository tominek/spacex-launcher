# Welcome to demo repo for Vue3 in SSR mode with Apollo Client

## Why this repo exists?
I have created this repo after many weeks of struggle
to configure Vue3 to run in SSR mode and use Apollo Client
while prefetching data on server and not after page is loaded on client.

## What are you looking at?
I have created basic [Quasar](https://quasar.dev/) project, no custom code, just standard stuff.
- project uses Quasar v2 therefore Vu3 with composition API
- I use Typescript
- there is Apollo Client extension for Quasar installed - `@quasar/quasar-app-extension-apollo`
- there is [GraphQL Code Generator](https://www.graphql-code-generator.com/) used to generate Typescript types and also query hooks
- I use [GraphCMS](https://graphcms.com/) demo project for SpaceX launches, so that's where the data comes from

## What am I expecting?
Some good soul that would be able to make this setup work.

## What else am I expecting?
That it will help other people in the future that encounter the same issue.

## How to help?
Fork the repo and make a pull request in case you come up with a working solution.
